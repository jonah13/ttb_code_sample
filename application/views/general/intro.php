				<h2>How's it Work?</h2>
				<p class="desc_service" style="margin-top:10px;"><img src="<?php echo img_url('ttb.png'); ?>" class="float_right" alt="QR code example" title="An example of a QR code that can easily be scanned by a smartphone" height="124" width="124" style="margin:0 0 10px 16px; padding:5px; background:white; -moz-border-radius: 8px; -o-border-radius:8px; -ms-border-radius:8px; border-radius:8px;" />Texting is now the most common form of communication in the world. Tell The Boss uses texting and Quick Response (QR) bar codes to send vital customer comments (in their own words) directly to corporate headquarters, franchise owners and managers. The ease and simplicity of the Tell The Boss service enables you to find out what your customers think faster and more accurately than other systems used today. Up-to-the-minute data can be accessed with a simple login to your account, and comments can additionally be sent—as customers submit them—right to your mobile phone and/or email address.</p>
